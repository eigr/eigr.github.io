In this talk, we\u2019ll\\nexplore an open-source Serverless runtime built for the cloud and on-premises,\\nrunning on the BEAM with a polyglot programming model to build general purpose\\napplications.\\n\\nBuilding general purpose applications using multiple languages and having a\\nstory how to handle state was our main motivation to explore the space of a\\nServerless runtime to be built. We think the BEAM, OTP and Elixir/Erlang are a\\nperfect match to build on.\\n\\nWith this talk, we combine herein the world of the BEAM with cloud technology\\nlike a gRPC-based protocol, Kubernetes and a polyglot programming model with\\nlanguages supported like Go, JavaScript, JVM-languages, Python and many more.\\n\\n**Event:**\\nhttps://icfp21.sigplan.org/details/erlang-2021-papers/13/Lightning-Talk-eigr-io-A-Serverless-Runtime-on-the-BEAM\\n\\n**\\nSlides:** [Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/MarcelLanz/eigrio-a-serverless-runtime-on-the-beam-acm-sigplan-icfp-2021-erlang-workshop)\\n, [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mLmSFY0z6gxoG88-phcFTwyVBMv8R9myBA5MZOWoJso/edit#slide=id.p1)"}]}')}}]);
