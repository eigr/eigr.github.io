It is with great pleasure that today we in the Eigr community officially release our first major release of our Stateful Serverless proposal called Spawn.

Spawn was a project started in May 2022 and therefore is still a very new project, on the other hand Spawn is the result of almost four years of research and development that we in the community have been carrying out around state-oriented Serverless technology. Our previous initiative, based on the now archived Cloudstate protocol, called Massa paved the way for this release. 

But with Spawn we decided to simplify while going far beyond Cloudstate's initial proposal. With Spawn we were able to solve many of the problems of the old protocol in a much simpler way, and this allowed us to focus much more on functionality to deliver to our users.

But at the end of the day what is Spawn? Well, there are some ways to define Spawn and its proposal for a State Oriented Serverless platform. But the one I like the most comes down to this sentence found in the project's github readme:

"Spawn is an Actor Model framework and Serverless Platform, which does a lot, really lot, of cool stuff that allows you to quickly deliver software oriented to your business domain."
